# Code for: Ocean surface wave slopes and wind-wave alignment observed in Hurricane Idalia

## Abstract
Drifting buoy observations in Hurricane Idalia (2023) are used to investigate the dependence of ocean surface wave mean square slope on wind, wave, and storm characteristics.
Mean square slope has a primary dependence on wind speed that is linear at low-to-moderate wind speeds and approaches saturation at high wind speeds ($>$ 20 m s$^{-1}$).
Inside Hurricane Idalia, buoy-measured mean square slopes have a secondary dependence on wind-wave alignment:
at a given wind speed, slopes are higher where wind and waves are aligned compared to where wind and waves are crossing.
At moderate wind speeds, differences in mean square slope between aligned and crossing conditions can vary 10\% to 15\% relative to their mean.
The dependence on wind-wave alignment is robust up to 30 m s$^{-1}$, but can be tenuous at the highest wind speeds near the center of the storm where wind and wave directions change rapidly. 
Mean square slope resolved by buoys is sensitive to energy levels within the spectral tail at frequencies corresponding to energetic gravity waves.
The contribution of these waves to form drag may help to explain the similar dependence of air-sea drag coefficient on wind-wave alignment.
